# COVID-19-ICU

This tool implements a SIRD model applied to COVID-19 spreading. 

**WE ARE CURRENTLY IMPROVING THE API; THE SOURCE CODE WILL BE PUBLISHED SOON**.

## The model

The model simulates the amount in time of the following variables: number of susceptible people (*S*); the number of infected patients (*I*); the number of people that recovered from the disease (*R*); the number of patients who passed away (*D*). The following set of coupled ordinary differential equations describe the rate of change of the four variables:
- ![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdot%20S%20%3D%20-%5Cbeta%20%5Ccdot%20S%20%5Ccdot%20I "dS/dt = -beta*S*I")
- ![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdot%20I%20%3D%20%5Cbeta%20%5Ccdot%20S%20%5Ccdot%20I%20-%20%5Cgamma%20%5Ccdot%20I%20-%20%5Cdelta%20%5Ccdot%20I "dI/dt = beta*S*I - gamma*I - delta*I")
- ![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdot%20R%20%3D%20-%5Cgamma%20%5Ccdot%20I "dR/dt=delta*I")
- ![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdot%20D%20%3D%20-%5Cdelta%20%5Ccdot%20I "dD/dt=delta*I")

The user must provide time-series of the number of infected, recovered and passed away patients. Then, four parameters are automatically calibrated against observed time-series:
- ![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csmall%20S%280%29 "S(0)") is the number of susceptible people in the population at t=0;
- ![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csmall%20%5Cbeta "beta") is the transmission rate;
- ![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csmall%20%5Cgamma "gamma") is the recovery rate;
- ![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csmall%20%5Cdelta "delta") is the fatality rate.
The rest of the initial state of the system (i.e., I(0), R(0), and D(0)) are automatically determined by the input time-series.

## Simulating lock-down events

Our tool allows the simulation of lockdown events. An event is modeled as a pair (days, ![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csmall%20%5Calpha "alpha")) where
- days is the number of days after the beginning of the time-series, in which the lock-down is applied;
- ![alt text](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csmall%20%5Calpha "alpha") is a scaling factor for the beta parameter, simulating a slower transmission rate due to limited social interaction.

The user can provide a list of events, in order to simulate the effect of multiple or pulsed lock-downs.

## Technical details:
- scipy's LSODA is used for ODE integration; 
- FST-PSO is the Computational Intelligence algorithm used for parameters calibration;
- the objective function used for the calibration is the cumulative RMSE error of the model with respect to the target time-series.
